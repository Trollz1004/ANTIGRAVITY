DAY 1 — FEB 27 (THU) — ORIGIN STORY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## REDDIT: r/SideProject
**Time**: 8:30 AM ET
**Title**: I'm an electrician who can't code. I used AI to build a dating app where $1 proves you're human and 60% goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

**Body**:
```
honestly been working on this for over a year and haven't really talked about it publicly.

I'm an electrician from Ohio. I literally cannot write code. but I spent the last year building a dating app where every user gets verified as a real human being. AI built the code. I built the mission.

here's how it works:
- you pay $1 to verify you're human. no bots. no catfish.
- 60% of every dollar goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals. from dollar one. forever.
- founding members get $14.99/mo locked for life (goes up after april 4th)

my brother is disabled. my niece is autistic. that's why 60 cents of every dollar goes straight to kids hospitals. not a marketing angle. that's just how I set it up from day one.

would love any feedback from this community. what would you change?

```

## REDDIT: r/ChatGPT
**Time**: 9:00 AM ET
**Title**: I'm an electrician with zero coding experience. I used AI to build and launch a full dating app with Stripe payments. AMA.

**Body**:
```
not a tech guy. not from silicon valley. I'm an electrician from Ohio who got fed up with fake profiles and decided to do something about it.

used AI tools (Claude, GPT, Gemini) to build the entire thing over 12 months. React frontend, Express backend, Stripe payments, the works.

the app itself is simple — every user pays $1 to prove they're human. no bots allowed. 60% of revenue goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

happy to answer questions about the build process, what worked, what didn't, and what it's like being a non-technical founder building with AI.

my brother is disabled.
my niece is autistic.

when i built this app i had a choice — where does the money go?

60% of every dollar goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

not eventually. not from profits. from revenue. dollar one. it's coded into an immutable smart contract that nobody can change.

not even me.

## REDDIT: r/OnlineDating
**Time**: 8:45 AM ET
**Title**: Tired of bots? I built a dating app where everyone pays $1 to verify they're human.

**Body**:
```
got catfished once. talked to someone for two months. turned out it wasn't even a person. just some bot farming engagement. that experience is literally why this app exists.

a dollar. that's what it costs to prove you're not a bot. you get verified, you're in. that same dollar? sixty cents goes to kids hospitals.

genuinely asking — would you pay a dollar to know that every single person on there is verified real?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## REDDIT: r/startups OR r/Entrepreneur
**Time**: 9:15 AM ET
**Title**: No VC. No code. No team. Just an electrician, AI, and a mission to send 60% of revenue to kids hospitals.

**Body**:
```
i'm an electrician. never took a CS class. never raised a dollar.

built a dating app over 12 months using AI tools. it's live. stripe payments work. real users can sign up today.

the concept: $1 identity verification. everyone on the platform is a confirmed real person. 60% of all revenue goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals via immutable smart contract.

founding member rate is $14.99/mo — locks forever for early supporters. goes up after april 4th.

not asking for funding. not asking for advice on how to scale. just wanted to share what's possible when you stop waiting for permission and start building.

the entire dating app industry runs on fake profiles.

more profiles = more swiping = more ad revenue. they have zero incentive to remove bots.

we have one rule: pay $1 to prove you're human.

bots don't pay.
catfish don't pay.
real people do.

that's the whole product.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## REDDIT: r/dating_advice
**Time**: 8:30 AM ET
**Title**: Honest question: would you pay $1 to guarantee every person on a dating app is verified real?

**Body**:
```
serious question. not trying to sell anything.

i got catfished bad. talked to someone for 2 months before realizing it was a bot. that experience broke something in me about online dating.

the whole industry profits from fake profiles. more profiles = more swiping = more ad revenue. they literally have no incentive to remove bots.

what if there was an app where the FIRST thing you did was pay a dollar to prove you're a real person? everyone on there did the same thing. no exceptions.

would that change how you feel about online dating? or is the problem deeper than bots?

genuinely want to hear your take.

## REDDIT: r/buildinpublic
**Time**: 9:00 AM ET
**Title**: Month 12 of building a dating app with AI. $0 revenue but 1,200 visits in one hour.

**Body**:
```
building in public because i think transparency is underrated when you're asking people to trust you with their dating lives.

stats:
- 12 months building
- 0 coding experience (i'm an electrician)
- AI wrote the code (claude, gpt, gemini)
- $0 revenue (pre-launch, april 4)
- 1,200 visits in one hour last week (organic, no ads — crashed our netlify)
- 5 stripe products live
- 60% of every dollar goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals

the hardest part isn't building. it's getting people to trust a platform built by one guy with no VC backing.

happy to share the full build stack, what worked, what didn't. AMA.

a year ago i didn't know what an API was.

today there's a live dating platform where every user is identity-verified, every dollar is tracked on a public blockchain, and 60 cents of every revenue dollar funds sick kids.

AI wrote the code.
i built the mission.

crazy what happens when the person building something actually gives a damn.

DAY 13 — MAR 11 (TUE) — URGENCY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## REDDIT: r/webdev OR r/indiehackers
**Time**: 8:45 AM ET
**Title**: I shipped a full-stack dating app using AI in 12 months. Here's the real stack, real costs, and real traffic.

**Body**:
```
non-technical founder here. electrician by trade. built this with AI assistance over 12 months.

stack:
- frontend: react 19 + vite + three.js
- backend: fastapi (python) + postgresql
- payments: stripe checkout (5 products live)
- hosting: cloudflare pages (moved off netlify after 1,200 visits/hr crashed free tier)
- ai tools used: claude opus, gpt-4, gemini

the product: dating app where every user pays $1 to verify they're human. 60% of revenue goes to shriners children's hospitals.

total spend: ~$200/mo (claude max subscription). no other costs.

biggest lessons:
1. ai writes code fast but debugging is still on you
2. stripe checkout > custom payment flow for solo founders
3. cloudflare pages handles traffic spikes that killed netlify
4. reddit drives more traffic than any other organic channel

launching april 4. founding member rate locks at $14.99/mo forever.

**Notes**:
- r/webdev cares about the tech stack. Be ready for detailed technical questions.
- r/indiehackers cares about revenue and metrics. Emphasize the business model.
- Pick ONE sub. Do not post to both on the same day.
- If r/webdev removes for self-promo, r/indiehackers is more lenient.

people keep asking me why a dating app donates to children's hospitals.

because i could.

the money was going to go somewhere. venture capital? marketing? google ads?

nah. sick kids.

it's not complicated. you just have to decide the money matters more going there than staying here.

A year ago someone told me "you can't build a tech company without a tech background."

Today my platform is live, payments work, and 60% of revenue goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

Turns out the gatekeepers were wrong.
