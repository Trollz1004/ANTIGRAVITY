## EMAIL 1 — THE LAUNCH

**Subject:** The wait is over. The bots lost.

**Preview text:** Every person on this platform is verified human. Starting now.

---

Hey —

You signed up for the waitlist because something about online dating is broken and you know it. I know it too. I got catfished. Talked to someone for two months before I figured out it wasn't even a person. That was the day I decided to build this.

**YouAndINotAI is live.**

Here's the whole concept in one sentence: you pay one dollar to prove you're a real human being, and then every single person you meet on this platform has done the same thing.

That's it. That's the product. No algorithm games. No swipe-farming. No bots. Bots don't pay. Scammers don't pay. You do — once — and you're in a network where every profile is a verified person.

**One more thing.** 60% of that dollar — and 60% of every dollar this platform ever makes — goes directly to Shriners Children's Hospitals. Not a pledge. Not a goal. It's coded into the infrastructure. Immutable. On-chain. Nobody can change it. Not even me.

My brother is disabled. My niece is autistic. That's why.

**Your $1 Bot-Shield verification is waiting:**

That single dollar proves you're real, funds a children's hospital, and gets you into a dating network that actually gives a damn who's on the other side of the screen.

See you inside.

## EMAIL 2 — THE ULTIMATUM

**Subject:** This rate dies on April 4th. Not kidding.

**Preview text:** $14.99/mo locked forever — only for people who got here early.

---

Hey —

Quick one. No speech.

Right now, before the official April 4th press launch, I'm locking in early supporters as **Founding Members at $14.99/month**. That rate stays the same for you. Forever. It never goes up. Even when the platform price increases after launch — yours doesn't.

**After April 4th, this offer is gone.** Not "limited time." Not a countdown timer that resets. Gone. The founding rate exists to reward the people who believed in this before anyone else did. That's you.

Here's what you get:

- Full platform access the second doors open
- Founding Member badge — everyone sees you were here first
- Priority matching queue
- Locked rate that never increases, no matter what
- The knowledge that 60% of your $14.99 goes straight to Shriners Children's Hospitals every single month

I don't have investors. I don't have a board. I'm an electrician from Florida who taught himself to code. The only reason this thing exists is because people like you showed up early and said "yeah, I'm tired of the bots too."

So here it is. Simple choice:

→ [**Lock In Founding Member — $14.99/mo forever**](https://buy.stripe.com/00w8wQaIYgjp5gF2cteEo0a)

Don't want the monthly? Grab a bundle and save:

- [3-Month Founder — $39.99 ($13.33/mo)](https://buy.stripe.com/dRm7sM5oE3wD7oNaIZeEo0j)
- [12-Month Founder — $99.99 ($8.33/mo)](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI5kEbN22szgZnaIZeEo0c)

Or if you haven't verified yet — start with the $1 Bot-Shield. It takes 30 seconds:

→ [**Get Verified — $1**](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI3cwcR6c3910p18peEo09)

April 4th is coming. After that, the founding rate is history.

## EMAIL 3 — THE ROYALTY PITCH

**Subject:** I built something I wasn't supposed to tell you about yet.

**Preview text:** The Royalty Deck of Hearts. $2,500. Only a few will ever exist.

---

Hey —

This email isn't going to the full list. Just the people who actually opened the first two. You earned this one.

I'm going to tell you about something called the **Royalty Deck of Hearts**.

When I was building YouAndINotAI — wiring houses during the day, writing code at 2 AM — I kept thinking about what it would look like if someone really believed in this mission. Not $15-a-month believed. *Put-their-name-on-the-wall* believed.

So I built the Royalty Card.

**$2,500. One time. Lifetime.**

Here's what it means:

- **Lifetime VIP access** — you never pay another cent. Ever.
- **Revenue share** — you earn from the platform's growth. Permanently.
- **Priority matching and dedicated support** — you're first in line for everything.
- **Exclusive Royalty badge** — the rarest profile marker on the platform.
- **Early access to every feature** — before anyone else sees it.
- **30-day full refund guarantee** — no risk, no questions.

But here's the part that matters.

**$1,500 of your Royalty Card goes directly to Shriners Children's Hospitals.**

Not eventually. Not after overhead. Immediately. It's enforced by a smart contract on the blockchain — Protocol Omega. Immutable. Auditable. Nobody can redirect it. The money hits the charity wallet the moment Stripe processes the payment.

Fifteen hundred dollars to children's hospitals. From one purchase. From one person who decided the kids matter more than another subscription they'll forget about.

I'm not going to pretend this is for everyone. It's not. $2,500 is real money. But if you're the kind of person who builds things, who backs missions instead of just talking about them, who wants their name permanently attached to a platform that exists to protect real humans and fund sick kids — this is the card.

There are only a handful of these. When they're gone, they're gone. I'm not manufacturing scarcity. I literally cannot offer unlimited lifetime revenue shares. Math doesn't work that way.

If you've got questions, reply to this email. It comes to me. Not a support team. Not a chatbot. Me. Josh. The electrician.

Thanks for reading this far. Most people don't.
