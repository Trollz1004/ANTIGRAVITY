### 1 — THE ORIGIN (Day 1)

i'm an electrician from florida.

i can't code. never took a class. never went to college.

but i got catfished by a bot for two months and decided nobody else should have to feel that stupid.

so i used AI to build a dating app where $1 proves you're a real human being.

### 2 — THE WHY (Day 4)

my brother is disabled.
my niece is autistic.

when i built this app i had a choice — where does the money go?

60% of every dollar goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

not eventually. not from profits. from revenue. dollar one. it's coded into an immutable smart contract that nobody can change.

not even me.

### 3 — THE FEATURE (Day 7)

the entire dating app industry runs on fake profiles.

more profiles = more swiping = more ad revenue. they have zero incentive to remove bots.

we have one rule: pay $1 to prove you're human.

bots don't pay.
catfish don't pay.
real people do.

that's the whole product.

### 4 — THE FLEX (Day 10)

just shipped something called the Royalty Deck of Hearts.

$2,500. lifetime VIP. revenue share. the rarest badge on the platform.

$1,500 of that goes directly to children's hospitals.

it's not for everyone. it's for the one person reading this who was going to spend that money on something forgettable anyway.

### 5 — THE ORIGIN x FEATURE (Day 13)

a year ago i didn't know what an API was.

today there's a live dating platform where every user is identity-verified, every dollar is tracked on a public blockchain, and 60 cents of every revenue dollar funds sick kids.

AI wrote the code.
i built the mission.

crazy what happens when the person building something actually gives a damn.

### 6 — THE WHY x URGENCY (Day 16)

people keep asking me why a dating app donates to children's hospitals.

because i could.

the money was going to go somewhere. venture capital? marketing? google ads?

nah. sick kids.

it's not complicated. you just have to decide the money matters more going there than staying here.

### 7 — THE FEATURE x CONTRAST (Day 19)

tinder made $1.8 billion last year.

they still can't tell you if the person you're talking to is real.

we charge a dollar and guarantee it.

weird how that works.

### 8 — THE URGENCY (Day 22)

april 4th.

founding member rate is $14.99/mo.
that locks forever. it never goes up for you.

after april 4th the rate increases and this page disappears.

not a countdown timer that resets. a real date.

if you've been watching — this is the window.

### 9 — THE WHY x TRANSPARENCY (Day 25)

here's the exact split for every dollar YouAndINotAI makes:

60% — Shriners Children's Hospitals
30% — servers, AI, anti-bot infrastructure
10% — founder sustainability

this is on the blockchain. public. auditable. immutable.

every other app tells you to trust them.
we tell you to verify us.

### 10 — THE CLOSER (Day 28 — one week before launch)

in 7 days this goes live.

no VC money. no board of directors. no marketing team.

just an electrician, three AI agents, and a smart contract that sends 60% of everything to kids who need it.

if that's not worth a dollar to find out if it's real — i don't know what to tell you.
