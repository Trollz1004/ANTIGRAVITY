### POST 1: r/SideProject (Post FIRST)

**URL**: https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/submit

**Title**: I'm an electrician who can't code. I used AI to build a dating app where $1 proves you're human and 60% goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

**Body**:
```
honestly been working on this for over a year and haven't really talked about it publicly.

I'm an electrician from Ohio. I literally cannot write code. but I spent the last year building a dating app where every user gets verified as a real human being. AI built the code. I built the mission.

here's how it works:
- you pay $1 to verify you're human. no bots. no catfish.
- 60% of every dollar goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals. from dollar one. forever.
- founding members get $14.99/mo locked for life (goes up after april 4th)

my brother is disabled. my niece is autistic. that's why 60 cents of every dollar goes straight to kids hospitals. not a marketing angle. that's just how I set it up from day one.

would love any feedback from this community. what would you change?

**Wait 30-45 minutes before next post.**

### POST 2: r/ChatGPT

**URL**: https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/submit

**Title**: I'm an electrician with zero coding experience. I used AI to build and launch a full dating app with Stripe payments. AMA.

**Body**:
```
not a tech guy. not from silicon valley. I'm an electrician from Ohio who got fed up with fake profiles and decided to do something about it.

used AI tools (Claude, GPT, Gemini) to build the entire thing over 12 months. React frontend, Express backend, Stripe payments, the works.

the app itself is simple — every user pays $1 to prove they're human. no bots allowed. 60% of revenue goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

happy to answer questions about the build process, what worked, what didn't, and what it's like being a non-technical founder building with AI.

### POST 3: r/OnlineDating

**URL**: https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/submit

**Title**: Tired of bots? I built a dating app where everyone pays $1 to verify they're human.

**Body**:
```
got catfished once. talked to someone for two months. turned out it wasn't even a person. just some bot farming engagement. that experience is literally why this app exists.

a dollar. that's what it costs to prove you're not a bot. you get verified, you're in. that same dollar? sixty cents goes to kids hospitals.

genuinely asking — would you pay a dollar to know that every single person on there is verified real?
