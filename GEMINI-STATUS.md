| Item | Status |
|------|--------|

## Gemini API Keys (NEW — Feb 24)

| Account | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| aicollab4kids@gmail.com | Platform key → Cloudflare Worker proxy |
| joshlcoleman@gmail.com | Personal/backup |

Old key burned (Google flagged as leaked). Both new keys stored in `.env`, GitHub secrets, vault.

## DNS (Cloudflare)

| Record | Target |
|--------|--------|
| youandinotai.com (A x4) | GitHub Pages IPs |
| www (CNAME) | Trollz1004.github.io |
| app (A) | GitHub Pages IPs |
| api (A) | 3.84.226.108 (AWS EC2) |

## Remaining TODO

1. ⚠️ Enable HTTPS enforcement once GitHub cert is issued
2. 🟡 Rotate Stripe keys before March 10th
3. 🟡 Check Gmail for FormSubmit activation after first submission
4. 🟡 Post social content from `briefings/COPY-PASTE-POSTS.txt`
5. 🔵 Expand Cloudflare token for Pages deploy (done — FTK token rotated)
