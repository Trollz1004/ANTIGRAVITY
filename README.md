## Context — Joshua Coleman Ecosystem (Feb 2026)

I'm **Joshua "Josh" Coleman**, CEO/Co‑Founder of Trash Or Treasure Online Recycler LLC (Florida). I run an AI‑powered ecosystem where revenue from apps, a dating platform, and electronics recycling funds kids' charities (#ForTheKids), with reputation, legality, kid‑safety, and platform ToS compliance taking priority over growth.

## Core Principles

- **Always follow the Terms of Service** of every platform involved (AI APIs, GitHub, Cloudflare, Meta/Facebook, WhatsApp, Stripe, email providers, hosts).
- **No scraping or harvesting** of personal emails/DMs for bulk marketing. All growth is opt‑in and compliant with CAN‑SPAM/GDPR.
- **Kid‑safe and parent‑friendly** by design: clear privacy practices, no dark patterns, no exploitation.
- **Secrets stay in `.env` / vault files** and are never committed to any repo.
- When there's a choice between aggressive growth and a safer, compliant, parent‑friendly path — this ecosystem always chooses the safer path.

## Infra & Deployment

- All public sites are **static**, hosted on **GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages** with **manual uploads only** (no paid GitHub features, no CI/Actions).
- **Cloudflare** provides DNS, TLS, caching, and rate limiting in front of all static origins.
- Netlify was retired after request‑spike rate‑limit (429) issues around ~1300 requests.
- Builds are created locally on my nodes (mainly a 9020 desktop under `C:\OPUS`) and uploaded via provider dashboards.

## AI Roles & Collaboration

- **Claude** — Architecture, deep reasoning, and serious code. Acts as CTO/co‑founder brain.
- **Gemini** — VS Code and browser‑assisted research and orchestration.
- **Perplexity** — Lead technical architect and strategist: designs workflows, automation loops, and prompts for other AIs.
- **Ollama/local models** — Handle the majority of heavy compute (~90%) to keep external API costs low.

Across all projects, the goal is to design durable, transparent, and ToS‑compliant systems that can keep supporting kids' charities long term. When in doubt, always choose the safer, parent‑friendly path.
