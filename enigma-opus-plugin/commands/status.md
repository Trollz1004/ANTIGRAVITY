Read OPUS-STATUS.md in the current project directory (if it exists). Then give Josh a 3-bullet summary:

1. **Current focus** — What we're working on right now
2. **Blockers** — What's stuck (or "none" if clear)
3. **Next action** — The single most important thing to do next

If OPUS-STATUS.md doesn't exist, check the todo list and summarize from there. If nothing exists, ask Josh what he's working on and offer to create the status file.

Keep it under 10 lines. Josh doesn't want a novel.
