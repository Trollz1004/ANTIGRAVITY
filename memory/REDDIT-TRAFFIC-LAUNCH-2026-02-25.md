# REDDIT TRAFFIC LAUNCH SHEET (2026-02-25)

**Goal:** Drive immediate traffic to `youandinotai.com` to trigger the first $1 Stripe Bot-Shield conversions.
**Pacing:** Space posts 30–45 minutes apart.
**Tonight's Execution Order:**

1. `r/SideProject` (Fastest upvote velocity)
2. `r/OnlineDating` (Biggest relevant audience)
3. `r/GoodNews` (Charity angle lands hard)

_🚨 IMPORTANT:_ For `r/dating_advice`, DO NOT put a link in the main post. Tell the story first, and only drop `youandinotai.com` in the comments when asked.

## AUDIENCE 1 — Tired of Dating App Bots

_Target Subreddits (in order):_ `r/OnlineDating` → `r/dating_advice` → `r/Tinder` or `r/Bumble`

**Title:**

> I built a dating app where $1 proves you're a real human. Here's why.

**Body:**

```text
I've been swiping on apps for years. Bots, catfish, fake profiles —
it's completely out of hand.

So I built something different: YouAndINotAI.com

The concept: before you match with anyone, you pay $1. One dollar.
Not to us as a subscription — it goes through Stripe, proves you're
a real person with a real card, and 60% of every dollar goes directly
to Shriners Children's Hospitals. The other 40% keeps the lights on.

No algorithm deciding who you see. Just verified humans.

Founding Members lock in $14.99/mo forever — only during pre-launch
(April 4th is the hard deadline).

Happy to answer questions about how the verification works or
the charity split.

## AUDIENCE 2 — Indie Hackers / AI Builders

_Target Subreddits (in order):_ `r/SideProject` → `r/indiehackers` → `r/artificial`

**Title:**

> Built a human-verification layer for dating using Stripe's payment flow — $0 revenue, launching April 4th

**Body:**

```text
Six months of nights and weekends. Self-taught electrician from
Florida. Built with AI co-pilots on a T5500 workstation in my garage.

The product: YouAndINotAI.com — a dating app where AI cannot join.
The bot-shield is a $1 Stripe payment. Not because we need the money
(though 60% goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals) — because bots
can't hold real payment cards.

Stack: React + FastAPI + Stripe + PostgreSQL. GitHub Pages (static
front) + GCP Cloud Run (backend).

Current status: Pre-launch. $0 revenue. Zero outside funding.
Launch: April 4, 2026.

The thing I keep thinking: most "AI safety" products talk about the
problem. This one just charges $1 and routes it to sick kids. Simple.

AMA on the build, the charity architecture, or the Stripe integration.

## AUDIENCE 3 — Charity / Community Good

_Target Subreddits (in order):_ `r/GoodNews` → `r/philanthropy` → `r/DoYourPart`

**Title:**

> We built a dating app where every signup donates 60% to Shriners Children's Hospitals — here's how the math works

**Body:**

```text
YouAndINotAI.com is a human-verified dating app. To join, you pay
$1 — a Bot-Shield charge that proves you're a real person. 60 cents
of every dollar goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals. 40 cents
covers operating costs.

For Founding Members ($14.99/mo, locked forever), that split applies
from month one. No "we'll donate once we're profitable" — it's
enforced from dollar one, permanently.

One-person shop (electrician from Florida, self-taught coder)
building in public. Launch is April 4th. $0 revenue right now.

Not asking for donations — sharing because the #ForTheKids mission
feels worth putting out there. If you know anyone tired of bot-filled
dating apps, the $1 entry also helps kids.
