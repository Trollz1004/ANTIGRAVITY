WHAT GEMINI CAN DO NOW:
- Generate marketing content for ANY of these 4 domains
- All facts above are verified and deployed — safe to reference
- The charity angle (#ForTheKids, 60% to Shriners) is the strongest differentiator
- Focus on youandinotai.com for the April 4 launch push
- Cross-promote the ecosystem (dating app users see the charity mission)

NEXT PRIORITIES:
- Stripe key rotation before March 10
- FastAPI backend for real user auth (April 4 launch)
- Redis + Qdrant integration for matching engine
- Multiplayer server.ts deployment to Cloud Run

This ecosystem is real. The charity is real. The code is deployed. Market it.
