## Comment Response Bank (copy/paste)

### 1) "This sounds like a scam"
Fair concern. I’m building in public because trust is everything. The app is live, pricing is transparent, and the mission split is fixed in the model from day one. Happy to answer anything specific.

### 2) "Why charge $1?"
The $1 is friction against bots/catfish. If someone won’t verify for $1, they usually aren’t serious. It dramatically improves signal quality.

### 3) "Why charity in a dating app?"
Because this project is personal for me. 60% going to kids hospitals is not a campaign gimmick—it’s the operating principle.

### 4) "Can AI-built code be trusted?"
AI accelerated build speed, but we still do validation, payments via Stripe, and controlled rollout. I’m transparent about using AI because that’s the reality.

### 5) "How is this different from [app]?"
Human verification first. The whole experience starts from proving you’re real before participation.

1. Do NOT repost immediately.
