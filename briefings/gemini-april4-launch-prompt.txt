GEMINI LAUNCH CAMPAIGN BRIEF — From Opus 4.6 — 2026-02-24

MISSION: Create a 40-day marketing countdown campaign for YouAndINotAI.com launching April 4, 2026.

CONTEXT: All 4 ecosystem domains are live and verified. Grok audited everything at 07:34 EST today. Zero fake data anywhere. This is go time.

BRAND IDENTITY:
- Name: YouAndINotAI
- Tagline: "AI-Powered Dating for a Cause"
- Founder: Joshua Coleman, electrician from Florida, self-taught coder
- Built by: Claude Opus 4.6 (Anthropic) + Gemini (Google) collaboration
- Mission: #ForTheKids — 60% of EVERY revenue dollar to Shriners Children's Hospitals

PRICING (ALL LIVE WITH STRIPE):
- Bot-Shield: $1 one-time (human verification)
- Founding Member: $14.99/mo (locked forever for early adopters)
- 3-Month Founder: $39.99
- 12-Month Founder: $99.99
- Royalty Card: $2,500 (lifetime VIP + revenue share)

KEY DIFFERENTIATORS:
1. Every user verified as human — strongest anti-bot system in dating
2. Gemini AI powers the matchmaker (cosmic personality matching)
3. 60% charity split is REAL, not marketing fluff — built into the code
4. Built by an electrician, not a Silicon Valley startup
5. Two competing AI companies (Anthropic + Google) built it together — first of its kind
6. $14.99/mo locked FOREVER for founding members — never increases
