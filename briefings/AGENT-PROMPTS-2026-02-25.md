# Agent Task Prompts — 2026-02-25

## 🐾 OPENCLAW PROMPT (paste into OpenClaw terminal)

```
You are in C:\Users\joshl\.openclaw\workspace. Your 4 live domains: youandinotai.com (dating), dashboard.aidoesitall.website (admin), onlinerecycle.org (crosslister), ai-solutions.store (charity). Redis is on 6379, Qdrant on 6333, Ollama on 11434 with llama2:13b.

Do these tasks in order. Commit after each.

1. REVENUE API — Create src/revenue-api/server.js (Express.js, port 3000):
   - GET /health → { status: "OPERATIONAL", timestamp, node: "T5500" }
   - GET /api/stats → pull real counts from Redis keys (leads, revenue, splits)
   - POST /api/gospel-split → accept { amount } → return { charity: amount*0.60, operator: amount*0.40 }
   - Use dotenv, cors, helmet. Connect to Redis on 127.0.0.1:6379.

2. GITLEAKS HOOK — Install gitleaks pre-commit hook so tokens never leak. One script, wire to .git/hooks/pre-commit.

3. EMAIL TEMPLATES — Use Ollama (http://localhost:11434/api/generate, model llama2:13b) to generate 5 pre-launch drip emails for youandinotai.com waitlist. Save output to memory/email-templates.md. Subjects should be compelling, not spammy. Theme: "Human connection in an AI world."

4. GOSPEL SPLIT DB TRIGGER — Create src/db/gospel-trigger.sql with the PostgreSQL trigger that enforces 60/40 on every INSERT/UPDATE to a transactions table. Include CREATE TABLE if not exists.

5. DOMAIN HEALTH CHECKER — Create scripts/domain-check.js that curls all 4 domains and logs HTTP status + response time. Save results to memory/domain-health.md.

6. Update MEMORY.md with everything you built and learned. Commit all.
