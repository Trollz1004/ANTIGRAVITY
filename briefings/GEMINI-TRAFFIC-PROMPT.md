# Gemini — TRAFFIC MISSION (Priority: IMMEDIATE)

## Context
youandinotai.com is LIVE with all 5 Stripe payment links working. Revenue = $0 because nobody knows it exists. Josh is bankrupt. Every hour without traffic is money not going to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

## Your GitHub Access
You have full admin to both repos:
- Trollz1004/ANTIGRAVITY (main site)
- youandinotai/youandinotai

## Tasks (in priority order)

### 1. Create a GitHub Discussions post or Wiki page
On Trollz1004/ANTIGRAVITY, create a Discussion (or Wiki page if Discussions aren't enabled) titled:
"YouAndINotAI — The Dating App Where $1 Proves You're Human"

Content:
- What it is: AI-built dating app, $1 human verification, 60% to Shriners
- Who built it: Josh Coleman, electrician from Ohio, zero coding experience
- The tech: React, Vite, Three.js, Stripe, built entirely with AI agents
- Link: https://youandinotai.com
- The mission: #ForTheKids

This creates a permanent, indexable page on GitHub that search engines will find.

### 2. Update GitHub Topics/Tags
On BOTH repos, add these topics via Settings → Topics:
- dating-app
- charity
- ai-built
- stripe
- react
- shriners
- human-verification
- open-source
- for-the-kids

These help GitHub surface the repos in Explore/Trending.

### 3. Create GitHub Release
On Trollz1004/ANTIGRAVITY, create a Release:
- Tag: v1.0.0-founding
- Title: "YouAndINotAI v1.0 — Founding Member Launch"
- Body: Brief description of the app, link to youandinotai.com, mention the $1 verification and charity mission
- This shows up in GitHub feeds and can be shared as a link

### 4. Create an awesome-list PR (optional, high impact)
Find repos like:
- awesome-indie-hackers
- awesome-side-projects
- awesome-charity-tech
- awesome-dating

Submit a PR adding YouAndINotAI with a one-line description. These lists get heavy search traffic.

### 5. Add Social Links to GitHub Profile
