PROMPT FOR GEMINI (Antigravity Agent) — Cloudflare Pages deploy verification
=============================================================================

Context: Opus (Browser Claude) completed repo cleanup on ANTIGRAVITY mono-repo.
Source HTML for Cloudflare-hosted sites lives in git but has NO auto-deploy pipeline.
Changes on main do NOT auto-deploy to Cloudflare Pages.

CURRENT STATE OF CLOUDFLARE-HOSTED DOMAINS:

1. onlinerecycle.org — Cloudflare Pages project "onlinerecycle"
   - Source of truth: _deploy/onlinerecycle/index.html (on main branch, commit 877f133+)
   - Has #ForTheKids banner, clean CrossLister AI branding, no unverified stats
   - Old stale file onlinerecycle-landing.html was DELETED from repo (pre-audit, no banner)
   - VERIFY: Is the LIVE site at onlinerecycle.org serving the version WITH the #ForTheKids banner?
   - If NOT: redeploy from _deploy/onlinerecycle/index.html via Cloudflare Pages dashboard or wrangler

2. ai-solutions.store — Cloudflare Pages project "ai-solutions-store"
   - Source of truth: ai-solutions-store-download.html (on main branch)
   - Fake countdown REMOVED, fake viewer counts REMOVED, "Instant Access" → "Secure Delivery within 24 business hours"
   - "January 2025" → "Q2 2026", "Opus 4.5" → "Opus 4.6"
   - VERIFY: Is the LIVE site at www.ai-solutions.store serving the cleaned version?
   - If NOT: redeploy

3. dashboard.aidoesitall.website — Cloudflare Pages project "jules-dashboard"
   - Source of truth: antigravity/ directory (Next.js 15 static export)
   - MRR shows "$100k+" with qualifier "Year 1 Goal — across all revenue streams"
   - VERIFY: Is dashboard live and serving correct content?

ACTIONS NEEDED:
- Fetch each URL and verify the LIVE content matches the audited source
- If any site is stale, redeploy using wrangler or Cloudflare dashboard
- Report back which domains are current and which needed redeployment
- Check that all Cloudflare Worker routes are correct (the onlinerecycle.org worker route
  was previously deleted because it was serving wrong content)

ALSO CHECK:
- DNS records for all 4 domains are pointing correctly
- SSL certificates are valid and not expiring soon
- No stale Worker routes interfering with Pages deployments
