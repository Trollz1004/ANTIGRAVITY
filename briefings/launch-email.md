# Launch Email — Founding Member Announcement

**Subject:** We're almost live — here's your founding member lock.
**From:** Josh at YouAndINotAI
**To:** Waitlist

Hey,

Quick and honest — we launch April 4, 2026.

YouAndINotAI is a dating app built on one idea: if you can't prove you're a real person, you don't get in. Our Bot-Shield verification costs $1. One dollar. That's what separates our platform from every app full of fake profiles and bots wasting your time.

You signed up for the waitlist, so you already get what we're doing. Here's the part that matters right now:

**Founding Members lock in $14.99/month. Forever.** That price never goes up. Not after we grow. Not after we add features. Not ever. The founding rate is a thank-you for believing in this before it was easy to believe in.

There's something else you should know. 60% of every dollar we make goes directly to Shriners Children's Hospitals. Not a percentage of profits after expenses. Sixty percent of revenue, from the very first transaction. That split is permanent and non-negotiable.

So when you pay for your membership, most of that money goes to helping kids get medical care they need. You're not just dating — you're doing something that actually matters.

I built this thing from a desk in Florida, teaching myself to code between electrical jobs. No investors. No board. Just me and the conviction that dating apps can be better than what we've been given.

Lock your founding rate before April 4:

Talk soon,
Josh
