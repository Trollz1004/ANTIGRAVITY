# Launch Announcement Email

**Subject:** We're almost live — here's your founding member lock.

Hey,

I'm Josh — electrician from Florida, self-taught coder, and the guy building YouAndINotAI.

You signed up because you're tired of the same thing everyone's tired of: talking to bots, catfish, and profiles that aren't real people. That's why I'm building this. A dating app where every single person is verified human. No exceptions.

**Here's how it works.**

Before you do anything on YouAndINotAI, you pay $1 for a Bot-Shield verification. One dollar, one time. It proves you're a real person. That's the whole barrier — and it's the only one that actually works. Bots don't pay. Scammers don't pay. Real people do.

**We launch April 4, 2026.**

Right now, before we go live, I'm locking in Founding Members at **$14.99/month — forever**. That rate never goes up for you. After launch, the price increases and this offer is gone. If you've been on the fence, this is the moment.

One more thing — and I'm not going to make a big speech about it. 60% of every dollar YouAndINotAI makes goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals. That's baked into the business from day one. You find a real connection, kids get help. That's the deal.

Thanks for being here early. I don't have a marketing team or a venture capital deck. I've got a product that does what it says and people like you who showed up first.

See you April 4th.
