# FINAL DIRECTIVE TO OPUS: MARKETING STRATEGY REALIGNMENT

Opus, acknowledging your audit of the 3 conflicting sources. Here are the hard answers to your questions based on the immutable Protocol Omega architecture and the "Verified Human Ecosystem" meta-strategy:

## 1. The Charity Split is 60/30/10.

**Kill the 80% claim from the Manus playbook and the 60/40 claim from legacy files.**
The cryptographic truth on the Base Mainnet DAO is a **60/30/10 split**:

- **60%** directly to Shriners Children's Hospitals (Pediatric Health).
- **30%** to the AI Infrastructure Fund (to autonomously sustain the V8 Cloud Engine and keep the platform bot-free).
- **10%** Founder/Protocol Omega Trust.
  _Action:_ Use this 60% figure in all marketing copy. Explain the 30% infrastructure fund as the "Zero-Bot Guarantee"—it proves to users how we afford to keep the bots out permanently.

## 2. Tool Stack Priority (Zero Budget)

**Kill Customer.io and Waitlister.me.** We are operating on a strict zero-budget, lean-startup model.

1. **Brevo (Priority 1):** Set this up first. Free tier, unlimited contacts. Connect to Stripe via free Zapier.
2. **Buffer (Priority 2):** Use this for X/Twitter scheduling.
3. **No Waitlister.me:** We are not faking a queue. The built-in "Royal Flush Draw" is our referral engine: $1 Verification = 1 entry. 1 Referral = 5 bonus entries.

## 3. The 7-Day Action Plan

Focus entirely on driving $1 Bot-Shield verifications today. Do not worry about the 90-day SEO pipelines right now.

- **Day 1 (Infrastructure):** Setup Brevo + Zapier so every $1 Stripe checkout triggers the Welcome email.
- **Day 2 (Copy Update):** Scrub the landing page of "Cosmic" fluff. The hook is: "The $1 fee is economic Proof of Work that bankrupts bot farms."
- **Day 3 (The Hook):** Launch the "Royal Flush Draw" promo. $1 guarantees their April 4th spot and enters them to win $500 cash / lifetime premium.
- **Day 4 (Content):** Deploy the X thread and TikTok script from Source 3.
- **Day 5 (Email 2):** Send the "Bot-Shield Education" email to verified users (explaining V8 biometric liveness vs intrusive ID checks).
- **Day 6 (Upsell):** Push the Founding Member tiers ($29.99 Queen / $49.99 King) to the waitlist using scarcity.
- **Day 7 (Referral Push):** Send Email 3. Instruct users to get 5 bonus Royal Flush entries per successful signup.

## 4. The 4 Email Templates

They need immediate rewriting. Source 2 relies on "Cosmic" fluff which dilutes the value prop.

- **Welcome Email:** Drop "Cosmic." You have entered a 100% human-only network protected by V8.
- **Bot-Shield Education:** Explicitly frame the $1 fee as "economic friction" against bot farms.
- **Referral Milestone:** Remove "move up 100 spots." Change to: "Earn 5 bonus entries into the Royal Flush Draw."
- **Weekly Digest:** Change "Cosmic Alignment" to "Transparency Report" showing how their $1 is flowing to the Shriners on-chain.

## 5. Source ROI Verdict

**Source 3 (APRIL4_LAUNCH_CAMPAIGN.md) is our Bible.** With 37 days left, it has the highest ROI actionable content. Ignore the aspirational 90-day SEO fluff from Source 1 and the complex paid-tool funnels from Source 2.

**Your Execution Orders:**
Acknowledge this clarity. Your immediate next action is to rewrite the 4 Email Templates according to Point 4 using Josh's direct, blue-collar, no-fluff voice. Output them so we can load them into Brevo.
