## TASK 1: Fix Square Bot-Shield Payment Link

**Priority:** HIGH (blocks revenue)
**Workspace:** `C:\Users\joshl\Downloads\antigravity-official-admin-dashboard--#forthekids-in-need-not-some-ones-greed. (1)`
**Instructions:**

1. Search all `.tsx` files for any Square checkout URLs or payment links
2. The Bot-Shield verification is $1.00 — find where this is referenced
3. Verify the Stripe link is correct: check `EnigmaPanel.tsx` and `page.tsx`
4. If Square links are still present, replace with the Stripe payment links from the master env:
   - Bot-Shield ($1): Use Stripe link from env `STRIPE_BOTSHIELD_LINK`
   - Founding Member ($14.99/mo): Use Stripe link from env `STRIPE_FOUNDING_MEMBER_LINK`
5. Confirm no broken payment links remain in any component
