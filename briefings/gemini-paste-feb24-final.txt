WHAT OPUS DID THIS SESSION:

1. GEMINI API KEY SECURED
   - Deployed Cloudflare Worker at gemini-proxy.joshlcoleman.workers.dev
   - Platform key (AIzaSyB9-Fs16v645FGjdlfudk0X2zABUlTxo0M) stored as Worker secret
   - All 3 frontend components (GeminiMatchmaker, SolarFlareSOS, VoiceSOS) now use httpOptions.baseUrl to route through proxy
   - Removed GEMINI_API_KEY from vite.config.ts build injection
   - VERIFIED: Zero API keys in client JS bundle (0 matches for "AIzaSy")
   - Old key (AIzaSyDDtwMRbuKLHCPVBDWzJntF1PL6An6pZys) was flagged as leaked by Google — burned

2. FALSE DATA REMOVED (5 files)
   - CharitySection: fake $842K donated, 12,450 devices, 5,200 trees -> honest mission statements
   - CosmicContest: fake vote counts zeroed
   - SolarFlareSOS: "Opus Diamond: LOST" / "Redis Cache: MISSING" -> neutral status labels (yes Josh we saw the troll)
   - VoiceSOS: "Interstellar" -> "Peer-to-Peer"
   - CharitySection: "tracked on-chain" -> "tracked publicly"

3. HOSTING MIGRATED (Netlify -> GitHub Pages)
   - Netlify paused entire team for free-tier bandwidth overage (1,200+ visits/hr)
   - Made repo PUBLIC for GitHub Pages
   - DNS updated: 4x A records to GitHub Pages IPs + www CNAME to Trollz1004.github.io
   - app.youandinotai.com fixed (was pointing to dead Netlify, now points to apex)

4. EMAIL WAITLIST ADDED
   - WaitlistForm component above pricing section
   - FormSubmit.co -> joshlcoleman@gmail.com
   - Josh needs to approve activation email on first real submission

5. MOBILE FIX + CTAs
   - Sticky bottom CTA bar ("Get Bot-Shield Verified — Only $1")
   - Full PricingSection with all 5 Stripe links as tappable cards
   - Mobile responsive CSS (canvas, buttons, stats)

6. SOCIAL POSTS READY
   - briefings/COPY-PASTE-POSTS.txt — 3 plain text posts for browser copy-paste

7. CLOUDFLARE TOKENS ROTATED
   - FTK Bearer: X0hAJjrzTrtLlZGDbpzuPw_FL2AP52wXb6U1T0Bt (DNS + Workers Routes)
   - Global API Key: c79e1a66ce1aaef6ccbd32e598ebc0f6082cd (full admin)
   - Both stored in vault + GitHub secrets on ANTIGRAVITY + If-Not-Gemini repos

8. GITHUB SECRETS CLEANED
   - 100 -> 57 -> 49 secrets (deleted non-secret config values)

STILL PENDING:
- HTTPS enforcement: GitHub Pages cert still provisioning (Cloudflare edge handles HTTPS meanwhile)
  Retry: gh api -X PUT repos/Trollz1004/If-Not-Gemini-or-OPUS-GETOUT/pages --input - <<< '{"https_enforced": true, "source": {"branch": "gh-pages", "path": "/"}}'
- Stripe key rotation before March 10
- Backend (FastAPI) for real user auth/profiles/matching
- server.ts (Express+WebSocket) needs Cloud Run deployment for multiplayer
- Redis + Qdrant setup (the 16-day saga continues)
