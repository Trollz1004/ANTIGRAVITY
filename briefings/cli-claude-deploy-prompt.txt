PROMPT FOR CLI CLAUDE (Opus on T5500) — youandinotai.com gh-pages rebuild + deploy
===================================================================================

Context: Browser Claude (Opus 4.6) completed a repo cleanup on the ANTIGRAVITY mono-repo:
- Removed build artifacts (antigravity/out/) from git tracking
- Removed stale onlinerecycle-landing.html (replaced by _deploy/onlinerecycle/index.html)
- Updated .gitignore and .env.example
- Verified gh-pages is currently serving youandinotai.com with a runtime patch script
  that catches old marketing claims, BUT the JS bundle was built from pre-round-2 source.

The gh-pages branch has a runtime patchClaims() script that regex-replaces old claims,
so the site IS safe right now. But the proper fix is to rebuild from the audited source
so the bundle itself is clean and the patch script becomes a safety net, not the primary fix.

TASK:
1. cd C:\OPUSONLY\antigravity  (or /home/user/ANTIGRAVITY on Linux)
2. cd youandinotai
3. npm install (if needed)
4. npm run build
5. Verify the built dist/ or build/ output contains NO bad claims:
   - Search for: "first human-only", "proves everyone is real", "No bots. No catfish",
     "impossible for bots", "Zero-Bot Guarantee", "93 of 100", "68%"
   - Confirm it has: "strongest human-verification system available",
     "real human verification + 24h bot report policy"
6. Copy the build output to a temp directory
7. git checkout gh-pages
8. Replace all files EXCEPT .git/ and CNAME with the new build output
9. Keep the existing patchClaims() script in index.html as a safety net
10. Keep the #ForTheKids banner div in index.html
11. git add -A && git commit -m "Rebuild from audited source (round 2 fixes baked in)"
12. git push origin gh-pages
13. git checkout main

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT touch main branch
- Do NOT delete the CNAME file (it points youandinotai.com to GitHub Pages)
- Keep the patchClaims() script even though the bundle should be clean — defense in depth
- Verify the site loads at youandinotai.com after push

STRIPE KEY REMINDER: Key expires ~March 10, 2026. Plan rotation BEFORE then.
