### Post 1

Half the profiles on dating apps aren't real people.

We built a $1 verification that proves you're human before you ever match with anyone. No bots. No catfish. Just actual people looking for actual people.

That's YouAndINotAI. Launching April 4.

$1 proves you're real. That's our filter.

### Post 3

60% of every dollar we make goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

Not a marketing stunt. Not a one-time donation. Sixty cents of every dollar, every month, written into the business from day one.

You date. Kids get help. That's the deal.

### Post 4

I'm an electrician from Florida who taught himself to code. I'm not a tech founder. I don't have a pitch deck or a Series A.

I have a dating app that verifies humans for $1 and sends 60% of revenue to children's hospitals.

### Post 5

You ever swipe right and immediately get a message that reads like it was generated by a microwave? Yeah. That's a bot.

$1 Bot-Shield. Prove you're human or get out.

### Post 6

The dating app industry made $5.6 billion last year. How much went to anything that matters?

We're sending 60% to Shriners Children's Hospitals. From the first dollar.

### Post 8

"Why would anyone pay $1 just to prove they're real?"

Because the people who won't pay $1 to prove they're real are exactly the ones you don't want to meet.

### Post 9

My kid is the reason I built this. I want him to grow up in a world where people actually look out for each other. Where a dating app can help sick kids instead of just making shareholders rich.

April 4. YouAndINotAI.
