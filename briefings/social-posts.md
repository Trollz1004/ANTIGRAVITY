honestly tired of matching with profiles that don't even have a real person behind them. so I made something about it. youandinotai.com — you pay a dollar to prove you're human. that's the whole filter.

my brother is disabled. my niece is autistic. every dollar this app makes, 60 cents goes straight to Shriners Children's Hospitals. not a marketing angle. that's just how I set it up from day one.

I wire buildings for a living. I don't know what a React component is. but I spent the last year building a dating app where every user gets verified as a real human being. AI built the code. I built the mission.

a dollar. that's what it costs to prove you're not a bot. you get verified, you're in. that same dollar? sixty cents goes to kids hospitals. I genuinely can't think of a better use for a buck.

april 4th this thing goes live. if you lock in now it's $14.99/mo forever. after launch it goes up and stays up. not trying to pressure anybody. just saying it how it is.

got catfished once. talked to someone for two months. turned out it wasn't even a person. just some bot farming engagement. that experience is literally why this app exists.

people keep asking me why a dating app sends money to kids hospitals. honestly? because I could. the money was gonna go somewhere. I picked sick kids over a marketing budget.

the dating app industry makes billions keeping you swiping. we charge a dollar to make sure you're real and send most of it to charity. our business model is literally the opposite of theirs.

every other app out there is trying to keep you on the screen as long as possible. more swipes, more ads, more money. nobody stops to ask if the person you're talking to is even real. I just wanted to build something where you know the answer to that before you say hey.

38 days. that's what's left before youandinotai goes live on april 4th. founding member rate locks at $14.99/mo and it stays there for life. after launch day that price is gone and it's not coming back. no tricks, no countdown timers that reset. just a real date on a real calendar. if you're in, now's when.
