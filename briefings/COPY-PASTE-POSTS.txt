We just crashed our servers.

Over 1,200 people hit YouAndINotAI.com in ONE HOUR looking for a dating app that proves their match is a real human — not a bot.

We're migrating to heavier infrastructure right now.

Lock in your $1 Bot-Shield spot before April 4th. Before the floodgates open.

Real talk: we just broke our own website.

1,200+ people showed up in under an hour to check out YouAndINotAI — the first dating app where AI PROVES your match is real, not a catfish or a bot.

Our servers literally couldn't handle it. We're upgrading infrastructure as I type this.

This is what happens when people are TIRED of swiping on bots. The demand is real. The frustration is real. And we're building the fix.

Founding Members get in for $14.99/mo — locked at that price forever. Or grab a $1 Bot-Shield badge just to prove you're human.

Zero VC funding. Zero ads. Just people who are DONE matching with bots.

Migrating servers now. $1 Bot-Shield spots are limited.
