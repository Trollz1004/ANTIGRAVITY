We recommend consulting legal counsel for any questions about your rights. We intend to have this document professionally reviewed before or shortly after launch.

## 1. Overview

We want to be fair. This refund policy explains what is refundable, what is not, and how to request a refund. Each product type has different terms because each product works differently.

All refunds are processed through **Stripe**, our payment processor. Refunds typically take 5-10 business days to appear on your statement, depending on your bank.

## 2. Refund Terms by Product

### 2.1 Bot-Shield Verification — $1

**Non-refundable.**

The $1 Bot-Shield fee pays for identity verification through V8 Cloud Verification. Once you submit your verification (government ID + selfie liveness check), the service has been rendered regardless of the outcome. This fee covers the cost of processing your verification, which is completed at the time of submission.

Exceptions:
- If our system charged you for verification but the verification process completely failed to run (technical error on our end, not a failed verification), we will refund the $1
- If you were charged more than once for the same verification, we will refund the duplicate charge(s)

### 2.2 Founding Member Monthly Subscription — $14.99/month

**Cancel anytime. No refund for partial months.**

- You can cancel your subscription at any time
- When you cancel, your access continues through the end of your current billing period
- You will not be charged again after cancellation
- We do **not** issue refunds for unused days in your current billing period
- There is no cancellation fee

**How to cancel:**
1. Use the subscription management link in your Stripe confirmation email, or
2. Email joshlcoleman@gmail.com with the subject "Cancel Subscription"

**Founding Member rate lock:** If you cancel and later want to rejoin, you may be subject to the then-current pricing. Your locked $14.99/month rate is only guaranteed while your subscription remains active and uninterrupted.

### 2.3 3-Month Founder Plan — $49.99

**Refundable within 14 days if no matches have been made. Prorated refund after 14 days.**

- **Within 14 days of purchase:** If you have not been matched with any other users, you can request a full refund. If matches have been made (meaning the platform presented you with at least one mutual match), the service has been partially rendered and a full refund is not available — but you can still request a prorated refund.
- **After 14 days:** You can request a prorated refund for the unused portion of your plan. The prorated amount is calculated based on the number of full days remaining in your 3-month period divided by the total days in the period, multiplied by $49.99.
  - Example: If you cancel after 30 days of a 90-day plan, you have 60 days remaining. Refund = (60/90) x $49.99 = $33.33.
- **No refund after the 3-month period ends.** The plan expires naturally.

### 2.4 12-Month Founder Plan — $99.99

**Refundable within 14 days if no matches have been made. Prorated refund after 14 days.**

The same rules as the 3-Month Plan apply:

- **Within 14 days of purchase:** Full refund available if no matches have been made. If matches have been made, prorated refund only.
- **After 14 days:** Prorated refund based on unused days remaining.
  - Example: If you cancel after 60 days of a 365-day plan, you have 305 days remaining. Refund = (305/365) x $99.99 = $83.55.
- **No refund after the 12-month period ends.**

### 2.5 Royalty Card — $2,500

**Non-refundable.**

The Royalty Card is a limited-edition product — only 5 will ever be issued. Because of its scarcity and the nature of the product (which includes a perpetual revenue share), Royalty Card purchases are final and non-refundable.

What you should know before purchasing:
- Only 5 Royalty Cards exist. This is not a mass-market product.
- The Royalty Card includes a 0.5% gross revenue share of the YouAndINotAI dating app, paid quarterly.
- The revenue share begins at purchase and continues for the lifetime of the dating app.
- If the dating app has no revenue, your revenue share payment will be $0. We do not guarantee minimum revenue.
- The Royalty Card is non-transferable at launch (transferability may be introduced in the future).
- The Royalty Card does not represent equity, ownership, or any governance rights in Trash Or Treasure Online Recycler LLC.
- See the [Terms of Service](TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md) Section 8 for full Royalty Card terms.

## 3. How to Request a Refund

To request a refund, email **joshlcoleman@gmail.com** with the following information:

- **Subject line:** "Refund Request"
- **Your name** (as it appears on your account)
- **Your email address** (the one associated with your account)
- **Product purchased** (Bot-Shield, Monthly, 3-Month, 12-Month, or Royalty Card)
- **Date of purchase**
- **Reason for refund request** (optional but helpful)

We will review your request and respond within **5 business days**. If approved, the refund will be processed through Stripe and returned to your original payment method.

## 4. Refund Processing

- All refunds are processed through **Stripe** to your original payment method
- Refunds typically take **5-10 business days** to appear on your statement
- The exact timing depends on your bank or credit card company
- You will receive an email confirmation when your refund is processed
- Refunds are issued in USD

## 5. Chargebacks and Disputes

We prefer to handle refund requests directly. If you have an issue, please email us before filing a chargeback with your bank.

Filing a chargeback (disputing a charge with your bank or credit card company) without contacting us first may result in:

- Suspension of your account pending investigation
- Loss of eligibility for future refunds
- Additional fees that Stripe passes to us, which we may contest

If you have a legitimate concern, we would much rather resolve it with you directly. That said, your right to dispute charges with your bank is a legal right and we will not retaliate against you for exercising it in good faith.

## 6. Exceptions and Special Circumstances

We understand that life happens. If you have a situation that does not fit neatly into the categories above, email us and explain. We will consider refund requests on a case-by-case basis for:

- Medical emergencies
- Accidental purchases (e.g., a child made a purchase on your device)
- Technical issues that prevented you from using the service
- Billing errors or duplicate charges

We are a small operation run by one person. We are not trying to keep your money unfairly. If something went wrong, reach out and we will try to make it right.

## 7. Account Termination and Refunds

If **you** delete your account:
- Active monthly subscriptions will be canceled at the end of the current billing period (no partial-month refund)
- Prepaid plans (3-month, 12-month) are eligible for prorated refunds per the terms above
- Bot-Shield and Royalty Card purchases are non-refundable

If **we** terminate your account for violating our Terms of Service:
- We are not obligated to issue any refund
- We may, at our sole discretion, issue a partial refund for prepaid plans depending on the circumstances

## 8. Merchandise (Square Store)

Merchandise purchased through our Square store (onlinerecycle.square.site) is handled separately from the dating app and is not covered by this refund policy. Square has its own refund and dispute processes. If you need to return merchandise, contact us at joshlcoleman@gmail.com and we will handle it directly.

## 9. Charity Disclosure

When we issue a refund, the corresponding charity donation (60% of ENIGMA revenue to Shriners Children's Hospitals) is also adjusted. In other words, we do not keep the charity portion of a refunded transaction — the full amount is returned to you.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Refund Policy from time to time. When we do:

- We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top
- Changes will not apply retroactively to purchases made before the update
- For material changes, we will notify users by email or a prominent notice on the platform
