> **Important Notice:** These Terms of Service were drafted without attorney review. They reflect our honest operating rules but have not been reviewed by a licensed attorney. We recommend consulting legal counsel for any questions about your rights or obligations. We intend to have this document professionally reviewed before or shortly after launch.

## 1. Agreement to Terms

By creating an account on YouAndINotAI ("the Platform"), you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.

These Terms are a legally binding agreement between you and **Trash Or Treasure Online Recycler LLC** ("we," "us," "our"), a Florida single-member LLC operated by Joshua Coleman.

## 2. Eligibility

To use YouAndINotAI, you must:

- Be at least **18 years old**
- Be legally able to enter into a binding contract
- Not be prohibited from using the service under applicable law
- Not have been previously banned from the Platform
- Complete identity verification through V8 Cloud Verification

We verify age and identity through our V8 Cloud Verification process, which requires a government-issued photo ID and a live selfie. If we determine that you are under 18 or have provided fraudulent identification, your account will be immediately terminated.

## 3. Account Registration and Security

### 3.1 Accurate Information
You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information when creating your account. You agree to update your information if it changes. Do not impersonate another person or use a fake identity.

### 3.2 One Account Per Person
Each person may only have one account. Creating multiple accounts is grounds for termination of all accounts.

### 3.3 Account Security
You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure. Do not share your password. You are responsible for all activity on your account. If you believe your account has been compromised, contact us immediately at joshlcoleman@gmail.com.

### 3.4 Verification
All users must complete V8 Cloud Verification, which includes:

- Submitting a government-issued photo ID (driver's license, passport, or state ID)
- Completing a selfie liveness check (a real-time photo confirming you are a real person)
- Passing anti-bot screening

> **Biometric Data Notice:** The verification process involves biometric-adjacent data collection (facial geometry analysis). By completing verification, you consent to this processing. See our Privacy Policy for full details, including your right to request deletion of this data.

## 4. What YouAndINotAI Is (and Isn't)

### 4.1 What We Are
YouAndINotAI is a dating platform that connects verified real people. We use AI (Google Gemini) to assist with matchmaking suggestions and conversation icebreakers.

### 4.2 What We Are Not
- We are **not** a guarantee that you will find a partner, match, date, or relationship
- We are **not** a background check service — verification confirms identity, not character
- We are **not** responsible for the behavior of other users outside the platform
- We do **not** create AI-generated fake profiles — every profile belongs to a verified real person
- We do **not** provide relationship counseling, therapy, or professional advice

## 5. Prohibited Conduct

You agree not to:

### 5.1 Safety Violations
- Harass, threaten, stalk, or intimidate other users
- Send unsolicited sexual content or explicit messages without mutual consent
- Use the platform to facilitate any illegal activity
- Engage in any form of discrimination, hate speech, or abuse
- Attempt to meet minors through the platform (automatic permanent ban and report to law enforcement)

### 5.2 Deception
- Create fake or misleading profiles
- Use photos that are not of you (no catfishing)
- Misrepresent your age, identity, or intentions
- Impersonate another person or entity
- Use the platform for commercial solicitation, scams, phishing, or spam

### 5.3 Technical Abuse
- Use bots, scripts, or automated tools to access the platform
- Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or hack the platform
- Scrape user data or profiles
- Circumvent verification, security measures, or rate limits
- Interfere with the platform's operation or other users' experience
- Attempt to bypass the Bot-Shield verification system

### 5.4 Intellectual Property
- Post content that infringes on others' copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property
- Redistribute or republish other users' photos or content without their consent

Violation of these rules may result in warnings, temporary suspension, or permanent termination at our sole discretion. Serious violations (threats, child safety concerns, illegal activity) will be reported to law enforcement.

## 6. User Content

### 6.1 Your Content
You retain ownership of content you post on the platform (photos, bio text, messages). However, by posting content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to display, distribute, and use your content as necessary to operate the platform (e.g., showing your profile to other users, displaying your photos in search results).

### 6.2 Content Removal
We reserve the right to remove any content that violates these Terms or that we determine is harmful, without prior notice. You can delete your own content at any time through your account settings.

### 6.3 Content Responsibility
You are solely responsible for the content you post. We do not pre-screen all user content but may review reported content.

## 7. Payment Terms

### 7.2 Payment Processing
All payments are processed by **Stripe**. By making a purchase, you also agree to [Stripe's Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/legal). We do not store your full credit card information — Stripe handles that.

### 7.3 Subscription Auto-Renewal
The Founding Member monthly subscription ($14.99/month) **automatically renews** each month until you cancel. By subscribing, you authorize us to charge your payment method on file each billing cycle.

- You will be charged on the same date each month (or the last day of the month if your start date does not exist in a given month)
- You will receive an email confirmation for each charge
- You can cancel at any time — see Section 7.4

### 7.4 Cancellation
You can cancel your subscription at any time by:

When you cancel:
- Your access continues until the end of your current billing period
- You will not be charged again after cancellation
- No refund is issued for the remaining days in your current billing period

### 7.5 Founding Member Rate Lock
The Founding Member rate of $14.99/month is **locked forever** for founding members — meaning as long as your subscription remains active and continuous, your rate will never increase, even if we raise prices for new subscribers.

If you cancel and later resubscribe, you may be subject to the then-current pricing.

### 7.6 Refunds
Refund terms vary by product. See our [Refund Policy](REFUND_POLICY.md) for complete details.

### 7.7 Failed Payments
If a payment fails (expired card, insufficient funds, etc.):

- We will attempt to charge your payment method up to 3 times over 7 days
- You will receive email notifications about the failed payment
- If payment is not resolved, your subscription will be suspended
- You can reactivate by updating your payment method

## 8. Royalty Card Terms

The Royalty Card is a premium, limited-edition product. Only **5 Royalty Cards** will ever be issued.

### 8.1 What You Get
Royalty Card holders receive:

- **0.5% revenue share** of YouAndINotAI dating app **gross revenue** (total revenue before expenses, fees, or charity split)
- Lifetime Founding Member access (no monthly fee)
- All future premium features included at no additional cost
- Recognition as a founding supporter

### 8.2 Revenue Share Details
- The 0.5% is calculated on the dating app's gross revenue (all YouAndINotAI subscription and verification revenue processed through Stripe)
- Revenue share payments will be made quarterly
- You will receive a statement showing gross revenue and your share
- Minimum payout threshold: $10 (amounts below $10 roll over to the next quarter)
- Revenue share does not include merchandise sales (Square store), donations, or revenue from other Trash Or Treasure Online Recycler LLC projects
- Revenue share begins when the Royalty Card is purchased and continues for the lifetime of the dating app

### 8.3 Tax Responsibility
You are responsible for all taxes on your revenue share payments. If your annual revenue share exceeds $600, we will issue a 1099 form. You agree to provide us with a valid W-9 (or W-8BEN for non-US holders) before your first payout.

### 8.4 Non-Transferable (Initially)
Royalty Cards are non-transferable at launch. We may introduce transferability in the future, including potential tokenization on blockchain, but make no promises about if or when this will happen.

### 8.5 Non-Refundable
Royalty Cards are non-refundable. See our [Refund Policy](REFUND_POLICY.md).

## 9. Charity Disclosure

60% of ENIGMA (profit-side) revenue from YouAndINotAI goes to **Shriners Children's Hospitals**. In plain terms:

- When you pay for a subscription or verification, Stripe takes its processing fees first
- Of the remaining revenue, 60% goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals and 40% goes to the founder (Joshua Coleman / Trash Or Treasure Online Recycler LLC)
- This split is permanent — it will not change
- This is enforced by an on-chain smart contract for transparency

This is our voluntary commitment. Your payment is for the dating platform service. The charity donation is something we do with our revenue — it is not a tax-deductible donation by you.

## 10. Intellectual Property

### 10.1 Our Property
The YouAndINotAI name, logo, branding, website design, codebase, and all original content created by us are the property of Trash Or Treasure Online Recycler LLC. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works from our intellectual property without written permission.

### 10.2 Your Property
You retain ownership of content you create and post on the platform. The license you grant us (Section 6.1) is limited to operating the platform.

### 10.3 Third-Party Property
Respect others' intellectual property. If you believe content on our platform infringes your copyright, contact us at joshlcoleman@gmail.com with:

- A description of the copyrighted work
- The location of the infringing content on our platform
- Your contact information
- A statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use is unauthorized

Some jurisdictions do not allow limitation of liability for certain types of damages. In those jurisdictions, our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 13. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Trash Or Treasure Online Recycler LLC, Joshua Coleman, and any affiliated parties from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) arising from:

## 16. Modifications to Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do:

- We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top
- For material changes, we will notify you by email or a prominent notice on the platform at least 14 days before the changes take effect
