> **Important Notice:** This privacy policy was drafted without attorney review. It reflects our honest practices but has not been reviewed by a licensed attorney. We recommend consulting legal counsel for any questions about your rights. We intend to have this document professionally reviewed before or shortly after launch.

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains what information YouAndINotAI ("we," "us," "our," or "the Platform") collects, how we use it, how we protect it, and what choices you have. We believe in plain English, so we've written this to be readable, not to bury things in legal jargon.

YouAndINotAI is a dating platform. Because dating involves personal and sometimes sensitive information, we take your privacy seriously. We do not sell your personal data to third parties. Period.

## 2. Who We Are

YouAndINotAI is operated by **Trash Or Treasure Online Recycler LLC**, a single-member limited liability company registered in Florida. The sole member is Joshua Coleman.

- **Website:** youandinotai.com
- **Email:** joshlcoleman@gmail.com
- **Entity:** Trash Or Treasure Online Recycler LLC (Florida)

## 3. Eligibility

YouAndINotAI is exclusively for users aged **18 and older**. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under 18. See Section 14 (Children's Privacy) for more details.

## 4. What Information We Collect

### 4.1 Information You Provide Directly

When you create an account and use our platform, you may provide:

- **Account Information:** Name, email address, date of birth, gender, sexual orientation, and relationship preferences
- **Profile Information:** Photos, bio text, interests, and other profile details you choose to share
- **Payment Information:** Billing details processed through Stripe (we do not store your full credit card number — Stripe handles that)
- **Communications:** Messages you send through the platform, support requests, and feedback

### 4.2 Verification Information (V8 Cloud Verification)

To protect our community from bots and bad actors, we use **V8 Cloud Verification**, which collects:

- **Government-issued photo ID** (driver's license, passport, or state ID)
- **Selfie / liveness check photo** (a real-time photo to confirm you are a real person and match your ID)
- **Anti-bot screening data** (device fingerprinting and behavioral signals to detect automated accounts)

> **BIOMETRIC DATA NOTICE:** The selfie liveness check and facial comparison process involve **biometric-adjacent data** — meaning your facial geometry is analyzed to confirm your identity. This data is used solely for verification purposes. We do not use it for advertising, profiling, or any purpose beyond confirming you are who you say you are. V8 Cloud Verification processes this data on our behalf. If you are a resident of Illinois, Texas, Washington, or any other state with biometric privacy laws, please be aware of this collection before proceeding with verification. By completing verification, you consent to this processing. You may request deletion of your verification data at any time (see Section 11).

### 4.3 Information Collected Automatically

When you use our platform, we automatically collect:

- **Device Information:** Browser type, operating system, device identifiers
- **Usage Data:** Pages visited, features used, time spent, click patterns
- **Location Data:** General location based on IP address (we do not use GPS tracking)
- **Log Data:** IP address, access times, error logs
- **Cookies and Similar Technologies:** See Section 9

### 4.4 Information from Third Parties

- **Stripe:** Payment confirmation and subscription status (Stripe does not share your full card details with us)
- **Cloudflare:** Security and performance data (DDoS protection, bot detection)
- **Google Gemini AI:** See Section 7

## 5. How We Use Your Information

We use your information for the following purposes:

- **Providing the Service:** Creating your account, displaying your profile, facilitating matches and conversations
- **Identity Verification:** Confirming you are a real person over 18 via V8 Cloud Verification
- **Matchmaking:** Using Google Gemini AI to suggest compatible matches and generate icebreaker prompts (see Section 7)
- **Payment Processing:** Managing subscriptions, processing purchases through Stripe
- **Safety and Security:** Detecting fraud, preventing abuse, enforcing our Terms of Service
- **Communication:** Sending service-related emails (account verification, subscription confirmations, important updates)
- **Improvement:** Analyzing usage patterns to improve features and fix bugs
- **Legal Compliance:** Responding to legal requests, complying with applicable laws

We do **not** use your information for:

- Selling to third-party advertisers or data brokers
- Creating AI-generated fake profiles
- Targeting you with ads on other platforms based on your dating preferences

## 6. How We Share Your Information

We share your information only in these circumstances:

### 6.1 With Other Users
Your profile information (name, photos, bio, interests) is visible to other users of the platform. That is the core function of a dating app. Your government ID, verification photos, payment details, and email address are **never** shared with other users.

### 6.2 With Service Providers
We use the following third-party services that process data on our behalf:

| Service | Purpose | What They Receive |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Stripe** | Payment processing | Name, email, payment method, billing address |
| **Square** | Merchandise sales (separate store) | Name, email, shipping address, payment method |
| **Google Gemini** | AI matchmaking and icebreakers | Anonymized profile preferences (no real names, no photos, no government IDs) |
| **Cloudflare** | Security, DNS, CDN | IP address, request headers, traffic data |
| **V8 Cloud Verification** | Identity verification | Government ID photo, selfie, device data |
| **GitHub Pages / GCP Cloud Run** | Hosting | Server logs, IP addresses |

### 6.3 For Legal Reasons
We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, court order, or to protect the safety of our users or the public.

### 6.4 Business Transfers
If Trash Or Treasure Online Recycler LLC is acquired, merged, or sells its assets, user data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We would notify you before your data becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

### 6.5 With Your Consent
We may share information in other ways if you specifically consent to it.

## 7. AI Usage — Google Gemini

We use **Google Gemini** to power matchmaking suggestions and generate conversation icebreakers. Here is what that means for your data:

- **What we send to Gemini:** Anonymized preference data — things like interests, relationship goals, and compatibility factors. We do **not** send your real name, photos, government ID, payment information, or messages to Gemini.
- **What Gemini does:** Suggests potential matches based on compatibility and generates conversation starter prompts.
- **What Gemini does NOT do:** Create fake profiles, impersonate users, or make autonomous decisions about your account.
- **AI-generated profiles:** We do **not** use AI to create fake user profiles. Every profile on YouAndINotAI belongs to a verified real person.

Google's privacy practices for Gemini are governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). We encourage you to review it.

## 8. Charity Disclosure

60% of revenue from the ENIGMA (profit-side) operations of YouAndINotAI goes to **Shriners Children's Hospitals**. To be clear:

- This is 60% of revenue **after** payment processing fees (Stripe takes its cut first)
- This applies to the dating platform revenue specifically
- The remaining 40% goes to the founder (Joshua Coleman / Trash Or Treasure Online Recycler LLC)
- This split is permanent — it does not change over time

This is a voluntary commitment, not a contractual obligation to you as a user. It is enforced by an on-chain smart contract for transparency.

## 9. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

### 9.1 What Cookies We Use

| Cookie Type | Purpose | Required? |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **Essential / Session** | Keeping you logged in, security tokens, CSRF protection | Yes — the site cannot function without these |
| **Analytics** | Understanding how users interact with the platform (page views, feature usage) | No — you can opt out |
| **Cloudflare** | Security (bot detection, DDoS protection) | Yes — required for security |
| **Stripe** | Payment processing (fraud detection) | Yes — required to process payments |

### 9.2 How to Manage Cookies
You can manage cookies through your browser settings. Blocking essential cookies will prevent you from using the platform. Most browsers allow you to:

- See what cookies are set
- Delete individual or all cookies
- Block cookies from specific sites
- Block all third-party cookies

### 9.3 Do Not Track
Some browsers send a "Do Not Track" (DNT) signal. There is no industry standard for how to respond to DNT signals. We do not currently alter our data practices based on DNT signals, but we also do not engage in cross-site tracking of our users.

## 10. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information, including:

- **Encryption:** Data is encrypted in transit using TLS/SSL (HTTPS)
- **Access Control:** Only authorized personnel (currently, that is just Joshua Coleman) have access to user data
- **Stripe PCI Compliance:** Payment data is handled by Stripe, which is PCI DSS Level 1 compliant — the highest level of certification
- **Cloudflare Protection:** DDoS mitigation and web application firewall
- **Verification Data:** Government IDs and selfies processed through V8 Cloud Verification are handled according to their security standards

No system is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security, but we commit to promptly notifying affected users if a data breach occurs.

## 11. Your Rights and Choices

### 11.1 All Users

Regardless of where you live, you can:

- **Access your data:** Request a copy of the personal information we hold about you
- **Correct your data:** Update inaccurate information in your profile settings or by contacting us

- **Opt out of marketing emails:** Unsubscribe links are included in any marketing email (note: we will still send essential service emails like payment confirmations)
- **Request verification data deletion:** Ask us to delete your government ID and selfie verification data

### 11.2 California Residents (CCPA / CPRA Rights)

If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA):

- **Right to Know:** You can request the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you, the sources, the business purposes, and the third parties with whom we share it.

- **Right to Opt-Out of Sale:** We do **not** sell your personal information. There is nothing to opt out of.
- **Right to Non-Discrimination:** We will not discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA rights.
- **Right to Correct:** You can request correction of inaccurate personal information.
- **Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Personal Information:** You can request that we limit our use of sensitive personal information (such as precise geolocation or government ID data) to what is necessary to provide the service.

To exercise any of these rights, email **joshlcoleman@gmail.com** with the subject line "CCPA Request." We will verify your identity before processing your request and respond within 45 days.

### 11.3 Other State Privacy Laws

Several other US states have enacted privacy laws (Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and others). While the specifics vary by state, we generally honor the same rights for all users: access, correction, deletion, and the assurance that we do not sell your data. Contact us at joshlcoleman@gmail.com to exercise any rights.

### 11.4 International Users

YouAndINotAI is operated from the United States. If you access the platform from outside the US, your data will be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the platform, you consent to this transfer. We do not specifically target users in the European Union, but if EU users access the platform, we will make reasonable efforts to honor GDPR-equivalent rights upon request.

## 12. Data Retention

We retain your data for as long as your account is active, plus a reasonable period after deletion to:

- Comply with legal obligations (e.g., tax records, fraud prevention)
- Resolve disputes
- Enforce our agreements

Specific retention periods:

| Data Type | Retention Period |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Account/profile data | Until you delete your account + 30 days |
| Payment records | 7 years (tax/legal requirements) |
| Verification data (ID, selfie) | 90 days after verification is complete, unless required longer for dispute resolution |
| Server logs | 90 days |
| Messages between users | Until either user deletes their account |
| Support emails | 2 years after resolution |

After these periods, data is permanently deleted or anonymized.

## 13. Third-Party Links

Our platform may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., Shriners Children's Hospitals, Stripe, our Square merchandise store). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. Please review their privacy policies before providing them with your information.

## 14. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)

YouAndINotAI is a dating platform for adults. **We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18.** This is consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which protects children under 13, but we go further by requiring all users to be at least 18.

If we discover that a user is under 18, we will:

1. Immediately suspend the account
2. Delete all associated personal data
3. Cancel any active subscriptions and issue refunds as appropriate

If you believe a minor is using our platform, please contact us immediately at joshlcoleman@gmail.com.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do:

- We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top
- For significant changes, we will notify you by email or a prominent notice on the platform
- Your continued use of the platform after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy
