Run the Iron Wall verification scan. Check that PROFIT infrastructure has zero contamination from CHARITY operations.

**Iron Wall rules:**
- PROFIT: SABRETOOTH (.8), Trollz1004, youandinotai, onlinerecycle orgs
- CHARITY: T5500 (.15), 9020 (.5), aicollab4kids org
- OMEGA/OMEGA365: DO NOT TOUCH ever
- Never reference charity in commercial context
- Never mix funds, infrastructure, or data

Check the current workspace and any recent changes for cross-contamination. Look for:
- Charity wallet addresses (0x222a...)
- Charity domains (ai-solutions.store)
- Charity orgs (aicollab4kids, omega365)
- Cross-node references

**If any contamination found:** STOP all operations, report exact file and line to Josh, do NOT modify.
