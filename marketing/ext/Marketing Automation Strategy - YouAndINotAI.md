## 2. Phase 1: Pre-Launch Automation (Current – April 3, 2026)
The primary goal is to build a verified waitlist and generate "organic buzz" through gamification.

### A. The "Cosmic Queue" (Waitlist Management)
*   **Tool Recommendation:** *Waitlister.me* or *GetWaitlist* integrated with *Zapier*.
*   **Automation Workflow:**
    1.  **Instant Welcome:** User signs up -> Automated "Welcome to the Galaxy" email.
    2.  **Referral Loop:** Provide a unique "Cosmic Link." Every referral moves the user up 100 spots in the queue.
    3.  **Milestone Notifications:** "You've moved up to the top 500! Share once more to reach the Top 100."

### B. "Bot-Shield" Education Series
*   **Content:** 3-part automated email drip explaining the V8 verification.
    - **Email 1:** Why 90% of dating apps are bots (The Problem).
    - **Email 2:** How Bot-Shield V8 works (The Solution).
    - **Email 3:** The $1 "Humanity Tax" – Why paying $1 saves you 100 hours of ghosting.

### C. Cause-Based Teasers
*   **Workflow:** Monthly automated updates showing the current "Potential Impact" based on waitlist size.
*   **Example:** "With 10,000 souls on the waitlist, we are on track to fund 5 life-saving surgeries on Day 1."

## 3. Phase 2: Launch Day Orchestration (April 4, 2026)
Automating the transition from waitlist to active user to prevent server overload and ensure high conversion.

### A. The "Big Bang" Rollout
*   **Automation:** Batch-release invites every 2 hours to manage server load (Ecosystem Status monitoring).
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **SMS/Email Alert:** "Your Cosmic Twin is waiting. The gates are open."
    2.  **Verification Bridge:** Automated redirect to the $1 Bot-Shield payment.
    3.  **Founding Member Upsell:** If verification is successful, trigger a one-time 24-hour offer for the $14.99 "Locked Forever" rate.

---

## 4. Phase 3: Post-Launch Engagement & Retention
Leveraging Gemini AI to automate personalized experiences.

### A. Gemini "Cosmic Twin" Weekly Digest
*   **Tool:** *Customer.io* + *Gemini API*.
*   **Automation:** Every Monday, the AI analyzes user interactions and sends a "Cosmic Alignment" report.
    - *Content:* "This week, your profile resonated with 4 'Cosmic Twins'. Here is why Gemini thinks you'll click..."

### B. Transparency & Impact Loop
*   **Automation:** Quarterly "Impact Reports" sent to every subscriber.
*   **Workflow:** Integration with *Shriners Children's Hospital* API (or manual data feed) to show: "Your $14.99 subscription this month helped fund [Specific Project/Equipment]."

### C. Re-engagement (Solar SOS / Voice SOS)
*   **Trigger:** User inactive for 7 days.
*   **Automation:** "Solar SOS" notification. "The galaxy feels empty without you. Gemini has found a new match that fits your updated interests."
