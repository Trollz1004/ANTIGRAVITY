---

## 📅 1. 40-Day Countdown Calendar (Feb 24 - April 4)

### Phase 1: The Origin (Feb 24 - March 4)
*Goal: Introduce Josh, the "Underdog" story, and the frustration with bots.*

- **Feb 24 (Day 40):** Announcement of the Countdown.
  - *Caption:* 40 days. 40 days until we take back the dating world from the bots. I'm Josh, an electrician from Florida, and I'm building a dating app that actually respects humans.
  - *Visual:* Josh in his work gear holding a phone showing the YouAndINotAI logo.
  - *Hashtags:* #BuildInPublic #YouAndINotAI #April4Launch
- **Feb 25:** Why I built this.
  - *Caption:* I matched with 5 "women" in one day. 4 were crypto scams, 1 was a ghost. I spent $30 on a subscription to talk to scripts. Never again.
- **Feb 28 (Founder Friday):** The GTX 1070 Story.
  - *Caption:* Most startups have a "Campus." I have a garage and a GTX 1070 that’s seen better days. But with Claude and Gemini by my side, we're building something bigger than Silicon Valley.
- **March 3:** Meet the AIs.
  - *Caption:* People asked how I'm building this so fast. It's a team effort. Claude Opus 4.6 (Anthropic) is my architect. Gemini (Google) is my matchmaker. Rivals working together for humans.

### Phase 2: The Mission (March 5 - March 14)
*Goal: Deep dive into #ForTheKids and the 60% charity split.*

- **March 5 (30 Days Out):** The 60% Promise.
  - *Caption:* 30 days to launch. Here’s the deal: 60% of all revenue goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals. Why? Because dating should have a purpose beyond just matching.
  - *Visual:* Graphic showing "60% Revenue -> Shriners".
- **March 10:** The $1 Bot-Shield.
  - *Caption:* Is your profile worth a dollar? Ours is. $1 verification ensures you're a real human. If you can't pay $1 to prove you exist, you're probably a bot.
- **March 14:** The "Royalty Deck" reveal.
  - *Caption:* Only 52 people will ever own a Royalty Card. $2,500. Lifetime VIP. Revenue share. And 60% goes straight to the kids. True digital ownership for a cause.

### Phase 3: The Tech & Features (March 15 - March 24)
*Goal: Show off the app, features, and the "Cosmic" brand.*

- **March 15:** The Cosmic Matchmaker.
  - *Caption:* Traditional apps match you based on distance. Gemini matches you based on your cosmic signature. Data-driven dating that feels like fate.
- **March 20 (2 Weeks Out):** Solar Flare & Voice SOS.
  - *Caption:* Safety isn't an afterthought. Our AI monitors for bot-like behavior and gives you an SOS line if things feel weird. We've got your back.
- **March 24:** Behind the Code.
  - *Caption:* Looking at the dashboard today. 1,200 visits in one hour crashed us last month. We're ready for the April 4 tidal wave.

### Phase 4: The Final Push (March 25 - April 3)
*Goal: Urgency for Founding Member pricing.*

- **March 28 (1 Week Out):** The "Last Chance" for $14.99.
