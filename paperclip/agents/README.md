## Restore Instructions

Copy the .md files from this folder back to:
C:\Users\joshl\.paperclip\instances\default\companies\{companyId}\agents\{agentId}\instructions\

Then reload the agent from the Paperclip UI.

## Required Files Per Agent

Each agent directory must contain:
- `AGENTS.md` — Identity, role, responsibilities, delegation rules
- `TOOLS.md` — Available tools, permissions, key IDs
- `HEARTBEAT.md` — Schedule, health checks, escalation rules
- `SOUL.md` — Who you are, why you exist, mission context

CEO additionally has:
- `SKILLS.md` — Skill boundaries and approval requirements

INTERN has only:
- `AGENTS.md` — DoWhatTold rules, social media idle behavior, speed enforcement
- `TOOLS.md` — Minimal toolset, no heartbeat, no soul, no skills
- No HEARTBEAT.md (doesn't think, doesn't self-check)
- No SOUL.md (no identity needed)
- No SKILLS.md (executes orders, doesn't choose)

## DAO Architecture (4-DAO Model, Updated 2026-04-19)

| Token | DAO | Platform |
|-------|-----|----------|
| $LOVE | Love DAO | YouAndINotAI.com |
| $UKID | #UntilNoKidInNeed | AI-Solutions.Store |
| $GREEN | AiGreenTeam | OnlineRecycle.org |
| $AGRAV | Antigravity DAO | AiDoesItAll.website |

2.5M tokens per DAO, 10M hard cap total.

## Models (updated 2026-05-03)

- CEO / CFO / CSO: `hermes_local` + `ollama/glm-5.1:cloud` — persistent memory, 30+ tools, Ollama auto-detect. CEO carries a 5-step fallback chain to `korpohermes-prime` and beyond — see `briefings/HERMES-CEO-READY-2026-04-19.md`.
- CTO / TechExecutor: `opencode_local` + `ollama/qwen3-coder:480b-cloud`
- CMO: `opencode_local` + `ollama/Trollz1004/dateapp-marketingtools` (platform-specific; fallback: qwen3-coder)
- UX Designer: `opencode_local` + `ollama/Trollz1004/dateapp` (fallback: qwen3-coder)
- Mission Guardians: `claude_local` + `codex_local` — daily audit only (86400s heartbeat, staggered)
- INTERN: any cheapest available Ollama cloud model (Gemma 1B is fine — INTERNs do not think)

## Change Log

- **2026-05-13** — Audit & optimization pass #4 by Claude Code Opus 4.7 (Josh delegated full operational control: "treat it as your own"; pasted latest Gemini Deep-Research / Cofounder-Triad doctrine into the CEO surface; manual edits frozen). Scope was CEO-centric. Changes:
  - **CEO/AGENTS.md** — Added missing `# AGENTS.md — CEO` header (was the only agent file missing it). Revenue Model section upgraded from the simplified 1-wallet line to the canonical 10-bucket compounding model from `briefings/DAO-TOKENOMICS-FINAL.md` (Platform Subscriptions, Super Likes, $LOVE/$UKID/$GREEN/$AGRAV staking yields, AI-Solutions, OnlineRecycle, Merch, $AGRAV infra) — flagged explicitly as internal architecture, never customer-facing. FL §496.405 framing clarified (statute alive; *internal* charity-routing doctrine terminated). Historical-artifacts list expanded to include the 60/30/10 split-era percentages explicitly. Added Financial Protection Rule (no tokenomics change without Opus + Josh dual-approval until revenue flows). Added Founding-Four section so the rule the heartbeat (step 8) enforces is documented inside the identity file itself. DAO table now includes the 15/65/10/10 per-DAO allocation, Base L2, soulbound, and the 2026-04-19 Claude CLI / Gemini Deep Research approval line.
  - **CEO/HEARTBEAT.md** — Step 6 forbidden-language scan expanded from 4 terms to the canonical 7 (`donate`, `donation`, `solicitation`, `charity`, `charitable`, `giving back`, `disbursement`) with the agent-internal allow-list for `contractual revenue disbursement` (matches CFO/CMO/Mission Guardians). Step 7 now references the 10-bucket model and the Financial Protection Rule explicitly.
  - **CEO/TOOLS.md** — Direct Reports table corrected: CTO `kimi-k2.6:cloud` → `opencode_local + qwen3-coder:480b-cloud`; UX Designer `kimi-k2.6:cloud` → `opencode_local + dateapp`; Mission Guardian (Claude) `kimi-k2.6:cloud` → `claude_local`; Mission Guardian (Codex) `qwen3-coder:480b-cloud` → `codex_local`. CFO/CSO/CMO now show full adapter syntax. Branch line fixed (was "branch: main", contradicting the canonical `claude/<short-description>` feature-branch rule). Primary model rewritten to `hermes_local + glm-5.1:cloud` (matches README + OPS-INDEX); previous "kimi-k2.6:cloud primary" line was drift. Fallback chain re-anchored to the live roster and explicitly supersedes the stale tail step in `HERMES-CEO-READY-2026-04-19.md` that still listed Anthropic + Gemini (violates the 2026-05-07 Token Doctrine).
  - **CEO/SOUL.md** — Added one short paragraph on the 10-bucket model and the Founding-Four permanence (so the file the agent reads to remember "who am I" matches the rules its heartbeat is enforcing). Customer-facing language ban referenced as the 7-term canonical.
  - **OPS-INDEX.md** — Most-Recent Audit Snapshots updated with this pass.
- **2026-05-06** — Audit & optimization pass #3 by Claude Code Opus 4.7 (Josh delegated full operational control over CEO / Agents / SKILLS-HEARTBEAT-TOOLS; "treat it as your own"). Fleet-wide language and protected-file reconciliation. Changes:
  - **Mission Guardian (Claude + Codex) AGENTS.md** — Rule 1 patched. Previously read "No 'donate', 'donation', or 'solicitation' anywhere ... zero exceptions" — that would have false-flagged the legitimate agent-internal `contractual revenue disbursement` synonym used by CEO/CMO/CFO. New rule: full 7-term customer-facing ban (`donate`, `donation`, `solicitation`, `charity`, `charitable`, `giving back`, `disbursement`) **plus** an explicit allow-list for `contractual revenue disbursement` in agent-internal copy only. Rule 5 protected-file list expanded to include `SOUL.md` and `SKILLS.md` (previously only listed AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md/TOOLS.md/HEARTBEAT.md). Rule 5 also notes the Josh-authorized Claude Code manual audit-pass exception (which is what allows passes like this one to land).
  - **Mission Guardian (Claude + Codex) HEARTBEAT.md** — Forbidden-language scan (step 1) updated to the full 7-term list with the agent-internal exception, protected-file scan (step 4) extended to include `SKILLS.md`, and a new **step 7: Founding-Four protection scan** (Gemini, Claude Code, Perplexity, Grok). Mission Guardian (Codex) now explicitly references the canonical step list owned by Mission Guardian (Claude).
  - **CTO/AGENTS.md** — Forbidden-language list expanded from 3 terms to the canonical 7. Branch policy reconciled (file previously claimed "branch: main, ONE repo ONE branch" while its own TOOLS.md correctly specified `claude/<short-description>` for feature work). Stack table now matches CLAUDE.md.
  - **CTO/SOUL.md** — Resolved the internal contradiction that read "Authoritative contracts live in `packages/contracts/src/`" while simultaneously calling those same files "history-only." New text: the three contract files (`CharityRouter100.sol`, `DatingRevenueRouter.sol`, `GospelDonation.sol`) are pre-1-wallet historical artifacts — present in-tree, not deployed, not called by active code paths, with the 4-DAO governance/staking design tracked separately in `briefings/DAO-ARCHITECTURE-CANONICAL.md`. Customer-facing language list expanded to canonical 7.
  - **UX (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, HEARTBEAT.md)** — Forbidden-language list expanded from 3 terms to canonical 7 across all three files. UI strings have the strictest customer-facing exposure, so this surface is now aligned with CMO. Internal-only allowance for `contractual revenue disbursement` documented (design briefs / Paperclip issues only — never in a UI string that ships).
  - **CMO/SOUL.md** — Added missing `disbursement` to the customer-facing ban list (previously had 6 of 7 terms). Added explicit FL §496.405 commercial-co-venturer framing so CMO understands *why* the ban exists.
  - **CMO/HEARTBEAT.md** — Step 3 forbidden-language scan expanded from 3 terms to canonical 7 with the agent-internal allow-list note.
  - **CFO/AGENTS.md** — Clarified the "§496.405 doctrine is terminated" line which read as if the statute itself had been retired. Corrected: the *internal in-platform charity-routing doctrine* is terminated; FL §496.405 is still the live statute that triggers commercial-co-venturer registration if customer-facing copy promises charitable disbursement — which is exactly why the language ban exists.
  - **CFO/HEARTBEAT.md** — Forbidden financial-claims scan upgraded to the canonical 7-term list. Token-cost step gained a >20%-of-baseline trigger.
  - **CSO/HEARTBEAT.md** — Strategic-risk scan (step 3) gained an explicit Founding-Four dilution-proposal check (any "consolidate / wrap / replace Gemini, Claude Code, Perplexity, or Grok" proposal flagged URGENT, independent of Mission Guardians' parallel Founding-Four scan).
  - **OPS-INDEX.md** — Most-Recent Audit Snapshots section updated with this pass.
- **2026-05-06** — Audit & optimization pass #2 by Claude Code Opus 4.7 (Josh delegated full operational control over CEO / Agents / SKILLS-HEARTBEAT-TOOLS). Changes:
  - **CEO/AGENTS.md** — split the doctrine line that previously placed `contractual revenue disbursement` in customer-facing copy. New rule (matches OPS-INDEX): `disbursement` is forbidden customer-facing; `contractual revenue disbursement` is permitted only in agent-internal copy.
  - **CMO/AGENTS.md** — scoped the language ban explicitly to "customer-facing" content/post/ad/copy and added the agent-internal exception so internal Paperclip issues are not over-restricted.
  - **CEO/HEARTBEAT.md** — added step 8: Founding-Four protection check (no wrapper / reroute / replacement of Gemini, Claude Code, Perplexity, or Grok without Josh's explicit order).
  - **CTO/HEARTBEAT.md** — added Opus Guardian invariant scan when product code changes since last beat (96% score floor; any drop = HIGH issue).
  - **CTO/TOOLS.md** — clarified branch policy (feature work on `claude/<short-description>`, never push direct to `main` without Josh's approval) and surfaced the Opus Guardian script path.
  - **CTO/SOUL.md** — replaced stale "PlatformSplitter / DAOTreasury / StakingVault / DAOToken on Base L2" reference with the canonical 4-DAO governance/staking model and pointed at `packages/contracts/src/`. Notes that legacy auto-routing artifacts (e.g. `GospelDonation.sol`) are history-only.
  - **OPS-INDEX.md** — new "Founding Four (Untouchable, Permanent)" section, new "Perpetual Mission Guarantee" section, and a "Most-Recent Audit Snapshots" pointer to the GH-Actions log + this manual pass.
- **2026-05-03** — Audit & optimization pass by Claude Code Opus 4.7. Resolved drift: Mission Guardian (Claude) heartbeat reconciled to 86400s in TOOLS.md (was claiming 3600s, contradicting HEARTBEAT.md and the README). UX Designer model corrected to `Trollz1004/dateapp` (was incorrectly listed as qwen3-coder). CEO/CFO/CSO/CTO/CMO TOOLS.md model lines unified with the canonical adapter syntax used in this README. CEO HEARTBEAT.md gained the workload-rebalance step (5+ open tasks → spawn INTERN) and explicit Mission-Guardian violation routing. CEO AGENTS.md updated to reflect post-launch reality (live since 2026-04-04). New OPS-INDEX.md added to this directory.
- **2026-04-19** — 4-DAO model approved by Claude CLI / Gemini Deep Research and locked.
- **2026-04-17** — Revenue model permanently changed to 1-wallet + 10% reserve (founder-directed). All charity-routing language removed from active surfaces.
